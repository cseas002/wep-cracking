# **WEP40 Cracking with FMS Attack**

### **Problem Statement**
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the vulnerabilities in the WEP40 wireless security protocol using the **Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir (FMS) attack**. The WEP protocol, which uses the RC4 stream cipher, suffers from predictable keystream biases caused by weak Initialization Vectors (IVs). Our project focuses on re-implementing the FMS attack to capture WEP packets, recover the WEP key byte by byte, and demonstrate how this old protocol can be cracked within minutes.
